[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c29c54d8-45d2-439b-b521-e8f169eca228/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/2026-be-my-valentine/deploys)

Hey there! 👋 This is a special little app whipped up for the Valentine's Day occasion in 2026. It's designed to spread some love, connect hearts, and maybe sprinkle a little digital confetti.

## Under the Hood 🛠️

We're rocking a pretty sweet tech stack here to make sure everything runs smoother than a cheesy pickup line. You can find the nitty-gritty details in the `conductor` directory, but here's the spark notes:

* **Framework**: Astro 5.0 (Hybrid mode for that speed)
* **UI Library**: Svelte 5 (We're fully embracing Runes like `$state` and `$effect`)
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom Valentine theme
* **Animations**: `svelte-motion` for the smooth moves and `canvas-confetti` for the celebrations
* **Backend**: Firebase & Firestore for real-time connection
* **PWA**: It's installable! Keep the love right on your home screen.

## Getting Started

Want to feel the love locally?

1. `bun install` to get the dependencies.
2. `bun dev` to start the heartbeat at `localhost:4321`.

## Credits

This project was built with 💖 using **gemini-cli** and **antigravity**.

*Happy Valentine's 2026!*
